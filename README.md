README GENERATOR AND VALIDATOR FOR ODOO
=======================================

This plugin is based on oca-gen-addon-readme from the repository [OCA/maintainer-tools.git](https://github.com/OCA/maintainer-tools). The original version is licensed under AGPL-3.

You can find the terms of the license in the LICENSE file available in this repository.

This small utility generates high-quality README.rst files along with a web page, which is displayed when reviewing the module's information. The webpage is located in the static/index.html directory.

The README generation starts by creating a readme directory in the module, containing a number of .rst files called *Fractions* where the developer can describe the module's functionalities in detail.

What gen_readme does:
---------------------

1. If the readme directory does not exist in the module, gen-readme will create the directory in situ, with all the fragments plus an empty README.
1. Make sure that the CONTRIBUTORS.rst section includes the developer(s) who created or modified the module, as there may be multiple authors.
1. Ensure that the word count in the DESCRIPTION section is at a reasonable level. This can be adjusted using a parameter.
1. Check that the module's manifest contains the author key, which usually refers to the intellectual property owner, typically the partner.
1. Additionally, at the request of Raiver Figueroa, ensure that the module has an icon.
